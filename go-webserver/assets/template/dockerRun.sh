# to create app.db, and crash-loops on "permission denied" -- a slow thing to

# On macOS (Docker Desktop, colima) the file-sharing layer ignores guest

cat <<NOTE

Running. State lives in ${APP_DIR_HOST} (mounted at /app/data):

  app.db      the database
  storage/    application files
  config.yaml optional; overrides defaults, overridden by the -e flags above

Back up that directory together with .secret_key -- either one alone is
useless.

What the flags above are doing:

  -p 127.0.0.1:...   Reachable only from this host. This app does NOT
                     terminate TLS -- put nginx/Caddy/Traefik in front and let
                     it hold the certificate. SECURE_COOKIES stays true
                     because that proxy is serving https; set it to false ONLY
                     for a plain-http local run, or the browser will drop the
                     session cookie and login will appear to do nothing.
  --read-only        The container cannot write to its own filesystem. Only
                     the mounted app directory and the tmpfs are writable.
  --cap-drop ALL     No Linux capabilities at all.
  --no-new-privileges  A process in here can never gain more rights than it
                     started with, even via a setuid binary.
  (non-root)         Runs as the image's unprivileged "app" user.
  --pids-limit/--memory/--cpus  Blast radius limits. Raise them deliberately
                     for real load rather than leaving these as-is and finding
                     out under traffic.

On a fresh database the server creates the first admin and prints a one-time
login link. Read it with:

  docker logs $CONTAINER_NAME

Then open https://your-host/login/<the-link> to sign in. Day to day, mint
further logins from the admin panel in the running app -- that goes through
the server and needs no downtime.

The CLI is for when you cannot get in at all. It works against the running
container -- the server listens on a control socket inside the data directory,
so the CLI never has to open the database itself:

  docker exec -it $CONTAINER_NAME /app/server manage reissue-login -user-id 1

If the container is stopped, run a one-off against the same data directory:

  docker run --rm -v "${APP_DIR_HOST}:/app/data" \\
    -e "APP_DIR=/app/data" -e "SECRET_KEY=\$( cat .secret_key )" \\
    $IMAGE_NAME manage reissue-login -user-id 1

SECRET_KEY must be passed, and must match, or the stored records cannot be
decrypted.

NOTE
