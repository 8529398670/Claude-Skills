// Package healthcheck is the `health` subcommand: the container's HEALTHCHECK.
//
// It lives in the binary rather than as a wget line in the Dockerfile for two
// reasons. The port comes from config/config.yaml, so a hardcoded URL in the image
// would silently go stale the moment someone changed server.port. And the
// runtime image then needs no HTTP client of its own.

// That endpoint touches nothing, so a slow database query can never get a
