// The owner is the one admin who outranks the others. It exists for a single
// decision the admin role cannot settle by itself: who may permanently delete
// an admin. Without it, any admin can delete any other, and the last one to
// act wins.
//
// # A marker, not a third role
//
// The owner is recorded as one id in the meta bucket rather than as a role
// beside admin and user. Roles are also what API keys carry and what
// NarrowRole compares, so a third one would spread into key scoping, role
// validation, and every role check in the app -- all to express something
// that only matters to a few account-management routes. As a marker, the
// owner is an ordinary admin everywhere else.
//
// # The invariant
//
// The owner is always an existing, enabled admin, or there is no owner
// because there are no admins. Every path keeps it: the first admin created
// becomes the owner (CreateUser), nothing may delete or disable the owner
// (DeleteUser, SetUserDisabled), and ownership only moves to another enabled
// admin (TransferOwner). That is also why the first-run bootstrap never fires
// again once an owner exists -- there is always an enabled admin.
