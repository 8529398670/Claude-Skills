// whole-file feature:logs
// Package stream is the helper for pushing live updates to a browser with
// server-sent events: an EventSource on the page, a Hub here, and Publish
// wherever something happens. See references/architecture.md for adding one.
//
// A stream outlives everything a normal request can rely on, so four things
// are handled here once rather than by each route:
//
//   - The server's WriteTimeout is a single deadline for a whole response, so
//     it would cut every stream off. Each write sets its own deadline instead,
//     which keeps the protection against a client that has stopped reading.
//   - Middleware runs once, at connect. A session revoked ten minutes later
//     would keep streaming, so the route's check runs again on every heartbeat.
//   - The writer runs on its own goroutine, where a panic would end the
//     process rather than one request.
//   - Connections do not drain by themselves, so a shutdown has to end them:
//     Hub.Close, from main.go.
