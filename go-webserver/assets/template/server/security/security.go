// right, and one place to look when auditing.
//
// There are two ways to prove who you are, and they meet here rather than
// anywhere downstream: a session cookie (a browser) or an API key in an
// Authorization header (a script, a cron job, another service). Everything
// past this package sees one Actor and one effective role, so a route does not
// know or care which door the request came through.
