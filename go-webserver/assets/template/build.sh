# Build portable, self-contained binaries -- one file per platform, each with
# the entire frontend compiled in.
#
# What you get is a single executable with no runtime dependencies at all: no
# Docker, no Go toolchain, no ./static directory, no language.yaml, no libc.
# Copy it to a machine, run it, and it serves the app. That is possible
# because of three choices working together:
#
#   CGO_ENABLED=0   static linking, so there is no libc version to match
#   go:embed        the frontend lives inside the binary (see embed.go)
#   bolt            the database is one file the binary creates on first run
#
# Docker is still the better answer for a long-lived internet-facing
# deployment -- it is where the read-only filesystem, dropped capabilities,
# and restart policy come from. These binaries are for everything else:
# handing a colleague a working copy, an internal box with no container
# runtime, a Raspberry Pi, a USB stick.
#
# Usage:
#   ./build.sh                  build every target below
#   ./build.sh linux/amd64      build one
#   ./build.sh darwin/arm64 linux/arm64

Done. ${OUTPUT_DIR}/ holds one self-contained binary per platform, plus
SHA256SUMS.

To run one:

  ./${OUTPUT_DIR}/${BINARY_NAME}_${VERSION}_\$(go env GOOS)_\$(go env GOARCH)

That is the whole command. No environment variables are required and no files
need to sit beside it -- the frontend is compiled in, and on first run it
creates its own state directory:

  ~/.config/${BINARY_NAME}/          (or \$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/${BINARY_NAME}/)
    app.db          the database
    secret.key      generated once, mode 0600
    storage/        application files
    config.yaml     optional; see config.example.yaml

Point it somewhere else with APP_DIR=/srv/${BINARY_NAME}. Ask a built binary
where it is looking with:

  ./${BINARY_NAME} manage paths

Two things to pass on with any binary you hand someone:

  * Back up that whole directory. secret.key encrypts the database, so
    app.db without it is unreadable -- and either one alone is useless.
  * SECURE_COOKIES must be true anywhere real, behind an HTTPS proxy. It
    defaults to true; set it false only for local http://localhost, or the
    browser will drop the session cookie and login will look like it silently
    does nothing.

The binary is also the admin CLI:

  ./${BINARY_NAME} manage list-users
  ./${BINARY_NAME} manage reissue-login -user-id 1
  ./${BINARY_NAME} version

If ./static or a language.yaml in the app directory exist, those are used
instead of the embedded copies -- which is what makes editing the frontend
during development work, and lets an operator reword the UI without a rebuild.
