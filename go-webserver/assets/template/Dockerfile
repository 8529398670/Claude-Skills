# CGO_ENABLED=0 produces a statically linked binary with no libc dependency,

# musl-vs-glibc surprises that come with cross-compiling against Alpine.
# -trimpath keeps build-machine paths out of the binary; -s -w drop the debug
# symbol tables, which shrinks it and removes a little detail from anyone
# poking at a compromised container.
# Version metadata, passed by scripts/docker.sh so that
# `docker exec <name> /app/server version` is as informative as a portable
# binary built by build.sh.

# and account administration is the "manage" subcommand -- so the image needs
# no static directory, no language.yaml, and no second executable.
#
# -tags container pins the image's fixed layout into the binary
# (server/config/layout_container.go): config at /app/config.yaml, state in
# /app/data. That is what replaces setting them through ENV, and it is why
# `docker exec <name> /app/server manage ...` needs nothing extra.

# There is no ENV here and no config.yaml in the image (.dockerignore keeps
# it out -- it holds the secret key, and an image layer is forever).
# dockerRun.sh mounts the project's config.yaml at /app/config.yaml at run
# time, so one image serves any deployment and a config change needs a
# restart, not a rebuild.
#
# server.static_dir (./static, beside config.yaml) does not exist in this
# image, so the embedded frontend is used. Mounting over it, or putting a
# language.yaml in the data directory, is the supported way to run the shipped
# UI with different wording:
#   -v ./language.yaml:/app/data/language.yaml:ro

# Only the data directory is writable, and only by the app user. Everything
# else stays owned by root and read-only to the process -- so even a bug that
# lets someone run code in here cannot rewrite the binary or the frontend.
# dockerRun.sh mounts /app/data as a volume and runs the container with
# --read-only, which is what makes that guarantee real rather than a
# convention.
RUN mkdir -p /app/data && chown app:app /app/data

# Note: this ownership survives into a *named* volume, but a bind mount
# shadows it with the host's ownership. dockerRun.sh uses a bind mount, so the
# database stays visible on the host for backups, and chowns that directory to
# this user before starting the container. Running this image against a bind
# mount without that step fails with "permission denied" on app.db.

# No EXPOSE: the port is server.port in config.yaml, and dockerRun.sh
# publishes it from there. A hardcoded EXPOSE would be stale documentation
# the first time someone changed it.
#
# `/app/server health` reads the same config.yaml for the port and asks
# /api/health, which touches nothing -- so a slow database query can never get
# a healthy container killed.
