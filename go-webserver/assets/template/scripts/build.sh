#
# What you get is a single executable with no runtime dependencies at all: no
# Docker, no Go toolchain, no ./static directory, no language.yaml, no libc.
# Copy it to a machine, run it, and it serves the app. That is possible
# because of three choices working together:
#
#   CGO_ENABLED=0   static linking, so there is no libc version to match
#   go:embed        the frontend lives inside the binary (see main.go)
#   bolt            the database is one file the binary creates on first run
#
# Docker is still the better answer for a long-lived internet-facing
# deployment -- it is where the read-only filesystem, dropped capabilities,
# and restart policy come from. These binaries are for everything else:
# handing a colleague a working copy, an internal box with no container
# runtime, a Raspberry Pi, a USB stick.
#
# The binary name, the output directory, and the target list are the build:
# section of config/config.yaml. Targets given on the command line replace
# the list for one run:
#
#   scripts/build.sh                  build every target in build.targets
#   scripts/build.sh linux/amd64      build one
#   scripts/build.sh darwin/arm64 linux/arm64

Done. ${OUTPUT_DIR}/ holds one self-contained binary per platform, plus
SHA256SUMS.

To run one:

  ./${OUTPUT_DIR}/${BINARY_NAME}_${VERSION}_\$(go env GOOS)_\$(go env GOARCH)

That is the whole command. No files need to sit beside it -- the frontend is
compiled in. Its one config file is ./config/config.yaml if there is one under
the directory it is started from, else ~/.config/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/config.yaml,
which it creates on first run along with the rest of its state:

  ~/.config/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/
    config.yaml     every setting, plus the secret key (mode 0600)
    app.db          the database
    storage/        application files

server.app_dir in that config.yaml moves the state somewhere else. Ask a
built binary where it is looking with:

  ./${BINARY_NAME} manage paths

Two things to pass on with any binary you hand someone:

  * Back up config.yaml together with app.db. Its secret_key encrypts the
    database, so app.db without it is unreadable -- and either one alone is
    useless.
  * server.secure_cookies must be true anywhere real, behind an HTTPS proxy.
    It defaults to true; set it false only for local http://localhost, or the
    browser will drop the session cookie and login will look like it silently
    does nothing.

The binary is also the admin CLI:

  ./${BINARY_NAME} manage list-users
  ./${BINARY_NAME} manage reissue-login -user-id 1
  ./${BINARY_NAME} version

If a static/ directory sits in the project directory (the folder holding
config/), or a language.yaml in the app directory, those are used instead of the embedded copies -- which is what makes
editing the frontend during development work, and lets an operator reword the
UI without a rebuild.
