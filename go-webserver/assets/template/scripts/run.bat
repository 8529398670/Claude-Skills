@echo off
rem Build and run the server from this checkout, outside Docker. The Windows
rem twin of scripts/run.sh: same commands, same behavior, except where noted
rem below.
rem
rem   scripts\run.bat                    rebuild if anything changed, stop the
rem                                      copy this checkout started last, start
rem                                      a fresh one here
rem   scripts\run.bat manage <command>   run an admin command against it
rem   scripts\run.bat <anything else>    same: passed straight to the binary
rem
rem The server runs in the foreground: its log streams here and Ctrl-C stops it.
rem Running scripts\run.bat again from another window stops this one and takes
rem over, so "edit, scripts\run.bat, reload the page" is the whole loop.
rem
rem With arguments it is a one-off instead -- the same build, then the binary
rem with those arguments -- and the running server is left alone. That is what
rem makes the admin CLI usable while it is up: `manage` talks to the live server
rem over its control socket rather than opening the database itself.
rem
rem   scripts\login.bat                                  owner's login link
rem   scripts\run.bat manage list-users
rem   scripts\run.bat manage create-login -name "Grace" -role user
rem   scripts\run.bat manage create-invite -user-id 1 -label "Book club"
rem   scripts\run.bat manage create-key -user-id 1 -name "CI"
rem   scripts\run.bat manage paths                       where the state lives
rem   scripts\run.bat config check
rem   scripts\run.bat config shell server                every resolved value
rem   scripts\run.bat version
rem
rem Where it differs from run.sh, Windows forces it:
rem
rem   - A running .exe cannot be overwritten. The build goes to .run\ and is
rem     copied over {{PROJECT_SLUG}}.exe only once the old server has exited;
rem     one-off runs use the copy in .run\ and never touch the server's.
rem   - There is no pid file. The old server is whatever process is running
rem     this checkout's {{PROJECT_SLUG}}.exe, which a full path pins down
rem     exactly, so a stale pid can never point at something else.
rem   - Windows cannot send SIGTERM to another console's process, so the old
rem     server is killed rather than drained. bolt is crash-safe, and the
rem     control socket a kill leaves behind is cleared on the next start.
rem
rem This is for development and internal boxes. It is a plain process with your
rem permissions -- none of docker\run.sh's read-only filesystem, dropped
rem capabilities, or pid and memory limits apply -- so use Docker for anything
rem long-lived or internet-facing.
