"""The API reference -- config/openapi.json and config/api.md -- written from
the code, so nobody edits either by hand.

Every route is declared once, by @route(...) on its handler (see route.py): a
summary, who may call it, and the types of what it takes and gives back,
which are msgspec Structs (see reflect.py for how a type becomes JSON Schema).
The same types check every request before the handler sees it. build() walks
the routes the app really registers, so the paths and methods come from the
route table, and a route whose handler was not declared is reported.

Nothing here runs while the server is up. scripts/api_docs.sh runs
app/tests/test_api_docs.py with --update, which writes the files; the same
test fails while a committed file is out of date. Go's twin is server/apidoc,
and the two write the same bytes.
