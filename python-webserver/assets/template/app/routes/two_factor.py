"""Two-factor sign-in, from a person's point of view: finishing a sign-in with
a code, and turning it on and off on their account (app/models/two_factor.py,
app/models/sign_in.py).

Setting it up needs a browser session, like every route that touches how an
account signs in: a key that could change this could lock its owner out, or
remove what protects them.
