"""Signing in with a login link. Redeeming a valid link is the login; there
is nothing to phish out of a user beyond the link itself, which dies on first
use. An account with two-factor on goes on to give a code (see two_factor.py).

It takes two steps. GET /login/<credential> only serves the app's page
(StaticServer.serve_login_page), which asks the person to confirm; the page
then POSTs the credential here. Link previews in chat apps, mail scanners, and
browser prefetch all fetch a URL without anyone asking them to -- if the GET
were the login, they would spend the link before its owner ever clicked it.
And someone already signed in is told that continuing switches accounts,
rather than being silently signed in as whoever the link belongs to.
