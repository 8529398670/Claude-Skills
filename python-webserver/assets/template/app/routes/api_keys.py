# whole-file feature:api_keys
"""API keys are how anything that is not a browser calls this API: a script, a
cron job, a CI pipeline, another service. A key carries a role from the same
set users do, so there is one permission model rather than two -- see
app/models/api_keys.py and references/architecture.md.

Every signed-in user can mint their own keys, and revoke or delete them. An
admin can additionally see, revoke, and delete everyone's, which is what makes
"who has standing access to this app" an answerable question, and can mint one
that acts as someone else (create_key_for_user).

Revoking keeps the row, marked dead, so the listing still shows the key
existed and when it stopped working; the purge drops it later. Deleting
takes it off every listing. Either one stops the key immediately. Only
delete can be undone: for RESTORE_WINDOW the restore routes put a deleted key
back, working again (the Undo on the frontend's toast). Revoke is the switch
for a key that may have leaked, and has no way back.

Minting, revoking, and deleting require a browser session (the routes are registered
behind RequireSession in app/routes/__init__.py), so a leaked key cannot
quietly mint its replacement. The admin routes that hand out login links
require one too, for the same reason -- see RequireSession.
