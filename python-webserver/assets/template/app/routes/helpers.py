"""Small pieces every route module uses: the shared dependencies, the one
error shape, and the rule for calling synchronous code.

The rule: SQLite and bcrypt are synchronous, and an async handler that calls
them directly stalls every other request while it waits. A plain-function
@route handler already runs in a worker thread and calls the models directly;
an async one reaches them through `await run(...)`, which runs the call in a
worker thread.
