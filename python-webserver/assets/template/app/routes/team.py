"""A non-admin view of who else uses the app.

It exists so that ordinary features -- an assignee dropdown, an owner picker,
an @mention list -- do not need admin rights just to render a list of names.
It returns id and display name only; role and disabled status stay behind the
admin endpoint, because those are facts about who administers the app rather
than about who you can hand work to.
