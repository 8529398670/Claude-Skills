# whole-file feature:invite_links
"""Joining through an invite link (see app/models/invite_links.py; managing
links is app/routes/invite_links.py).

Everything here is public -- holding the link is the permission -- so every
POST is held to the same rule as /api/login: a JSON body from one of this
site's own pages (same_origin_json). The credential travels in the body,
never a query string, and the page that carries it in its path is served with
no-referrer (StaticServer.serve_login_page, which both link pages share).

A bad, expired, switched-off, or orphaned link always answers 404
invite_link_invalid, whichever of those it was.
