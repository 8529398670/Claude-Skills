# whole-file feature:mcp
"""The MCP side of accounts and sign-in: login links, accounts, devices and
invite links. Each tool stands for its HTTP route and runs the route's own
handler (mcp= in its @route(...)), so the rules (who may touch the owner, what a
narrowed key may not do) hold whichever door a request comes through.

A login link or invite link made here records the key that asked, and revoking
or deleting that key voids it while it can still be used (see
login_tokens.void_links_minted_by_key). That is what keeps revoking a leaked
key meaningful now that a key can hand out ways in.

These are the calls of the tools that add to their route's answer. The Go
template's mcp_tools_accounts.go has the same, and both write the same
config/mcp.json.
