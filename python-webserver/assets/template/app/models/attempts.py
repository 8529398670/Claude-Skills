# whole-file feature:passwords|two_factor|invite_links
"""Limits wrong guesses at anything a person types: a PIN, a password, a
two-factor code. Six digits is a million guesses, and four is ten thousand, so
without this those are decoration.

In memory, like the rate limiter -- so it resets on restart and is per
process. It is a brake on guessing, not a record of anything.

Reserve, then settle: a route calls reserve() before it checks the guess and
settles the Attempt after, with how it went. reserve() counts the attempt in
flight, under the lock, and refuses once the misses so far plus the attempts
in flight reach max_failures. So guesses sent in parallel cannot all slip past
a check that only counts finished ones: twenty at once still get max_failures
evaluated, no more. Checking locked() and calling record() afterwards has
exactly that race, which is why the routes do not.
