"""config/mcp.json -- the MCP reference -- built from the registered tools.

It is what tools/list says, for every tool and any key, with the HTTP route
each one stands for and the routes a key may call that stay HTTP only (their
mcp_http reason in the API docs). It names no features: scaffold.py's prune
step cuts a tool out by its route. scripts/api_docs.sh writes it, and
app/tests/test_api_docs.py fails while the committed file is out of date.
