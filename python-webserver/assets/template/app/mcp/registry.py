"""What a tool is, how it reads its arguments, and how it says no.

Adding one is the MCP version of adding a route: mcp="tool_name" in the
@route(...) of the route it stands for (build_registry in
app/routes/mcp_tools.py makes it with Tool.for_route). It takes the route's
request type and runs the route's own handler, so a rule enforced there holds
whichever door a change comes through. The rules match the rest of the
template:

- One tool per route an API key may call. test_mcp_parity.py fails until
  every key-callable route in the API docs has a tool, or an mcp_http reason
  in its @route(...) for staying HTTP only (file bytes, for one: MCP messages
  are JSON, and clients cap their size, so uploads and downloads go over
  /api/files with the same key and the tool hands back the addresses).
- Any signed-in key, unless the route is admin only. admin_only hides the
  tool from user-scoped keys entirely.
- Nothing a key cannot do over HTTP. Managing users, keys and sign-in, and
  erasing anything for good, need a browser session (see RequireSession), so
  that revoking a leaked key really ends it and a key can never erase what
  cannot be put back. A tool is a key-authenticated route; the same rule keeps
  those out.
- Mark the hints honestly. read_only and destructive become the spec's
  readOnlyHint / destructiveHint, which a client uses to decide whether to ask
  the person before calling. They are advice to the client, not protection --
  the protection is the role check and the model rules.
