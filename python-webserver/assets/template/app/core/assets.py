"""Decides where the frontend comes from: a configured location, or the copy
that ships with the code.

This is the Python counterpart of the Go template's "disk or embedded"
choice. There is no embedding here -- the code always has its own static/ and
language.yaml beside the app/ package -- but the rule is the same:

  - server.static_dir is used when that directory exists. It defaults to
    ./static beside config.yaml, which in a source checkout *is* the code's
    copy, so editing a file and refreshing just works.
  - Run with a config.yaml somewhere else (~/.config/<slug>/), there is no
    static/ beside it, and the bundled copy is used.

The static tree and the language file are decided independently on purpose:
dropping a language.yaml into the app directory rewords the UI while the
frontend itself stays the shipped one. That is the supported way for an
operator to translate or soften a deployment's copy without touching code.
